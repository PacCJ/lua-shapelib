This is a fork of https://github.com/dminor/lua-shapelib

Lua bindings for the for the Shapelib (http://shapelib.maptools.org/) library for working with shapefiles.

The interface for shapefiles allows the shape handle to be indexed to retrieve objects in the shapefile.  The interface for dbf files follows the C API closely.

See the examples folder for usage.
